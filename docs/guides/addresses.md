# Addresses

Addresses are an integral part of the Birchbox experience, as they would be for any retail business. Each user can have multiple addresses. Addresses can be tied to a subscription \(as in, the address we will ship the box to\), a credit card \(as a billing address\), both, or neither. Also keep in mind that we support multiple countriesâ€™s address types, which can complicate the logic significantly.

## Address Components

* Use [Address](../components/address.md) if you want to display an address.
* Use [AddressFields](../components/addressfields.md) if you want to capture an address _along with other data_ in a form.
* Use [AddressForm](../components/addressform.md) if you want to only capture an address \(i.e. submit & cancel buttons included\).
* Use [AddressList](../components/addresslist.md) if you want to pick from a list of existing addresses.
* Use [AddressSelector](../components/addressselector.md) if you want to toggle between `AddressList` and `AddressFields`.
* Use [AddressUsageCheckboxes](../components/addressselector.md) for editing how an address is used by the system. For example for subscription shipping or default shop billing. Typically used with AddressFields.

## Address Utils

* Use [`verifyAddress`](../utils/verifyaddress.md) to verify an address with Smarty Streets before saving.
