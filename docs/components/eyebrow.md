# Eyebrow

[`Eyebrow`](https://github.com/zakness/birchbox-gitbook/tree/1ad9356b440d8ffd191f6222475ef6f0c15444b0/src/components/Eyebrow/index.js) is a short markdown message controlled by the `eyebrow` Asset Broker block.

This is called `Eyebrow` because it used to live in the upper-lefthand corner of the global navigation. Now it lives in the cart because the message it displays explains the free shipping policy \(and has for some time\).

We expect this state of affairs to be temporary \(knock on wood\). If we want to keep the current experience, the component and AB block will be renamed to reflect its new home.
