# Getting Started

## Developing on local machine

### Environment Dependencies

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) v6.6.0
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)

### Installation

Clone repo and install external dependencies:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:/birchbox/bernard_black && cd bernard_black
yarn
```

#### Running app server

```
TARGET=[com|es|uk] yarn run start
```

Site now available at `localhost:3000` using staging backend.

#### Running app server with a built webpack bundle and hot reload turned off

```
TARGET=[com|es|uk] yarn run start-bundle
```

Site now available at `localhost:3000` using staging backend.

#### Adding dependencies

```sh
yarn add ...
```
Consult yarn [docs](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/migrating-from-npm#toc-cli-commands-comparison) for specific options

## Developing on dev container

On dev containers, Tech Ops has built a `node-app` CLI for managing the node server. The process is run in a separate environment, so you cannot run the `package.json` scripts directly like you can when developing locally.

Each target (com, es, uk) runs in a separate dev container.

#### App URL

```sh
https://app.USER.dev.birchbox.TLD
```

#### Repo location

```sh
cd ~/unit/TLD.birchbox.app/repo
```

#### Issue commands to node app

```sh
node-app -c [start, stop, restart, check]
```

Note that when the server is restarted, it takes up to a minute to rebuild the app and begin handling requests again.

#### Update or reinstall dependencies

```sh
node-app -c [update, reinstall]
```
`update` will run `npm install` and restart the server. `reinstall` does the same, but deletes the `node_modules` directory first.

#### Use staging APIs

By default the node app will use your dev containerâ€™s APIs. If you want to use staging instead, use the `API_ENV` environment variable:

```sh
API_ENV=staging node-app -c restart
```

#### Node server logs

```sh
cd ~/unit/TLD.birchbox.app/log/node-app
tail current
```
